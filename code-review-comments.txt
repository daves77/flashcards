Code Review comments from Michelle and Mike

Good points
- css looks really good, polished, and product ready!
- nice that you explored modules not covered in the materieal: tailwind, express.Router, bcrypt 
- folder and file structure is very organized. nice that cards, user, and home are separate.

Points to Improve
- minor issue in some routes: error case only has a console.log(), and no res.send()...
- code is generally good and clean. Better to add more functionality to make it more useful. :D 
  - next project can be more imaginative. :D
